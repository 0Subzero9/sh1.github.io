        <p>My memories consist of only getting exchanged. Someone gives me to someone else, they again give me to someone else. All for hunger, lot for comfort, some for vanity. Just like everyone, I may have forgotten most of my past memories, but I clearly remember my first few days outside. Humans do not remember their first days but they do retain some memories of early childhood. My first days in the outside world are comparable to that. <br>
            <br>
            That day, I remember being taken out of the safe I had ben in all my life. I was bundled up and taken out by some gloved hands and given to a hand. I remember one fact clearly. His hands were… average. They did have some dirty bits here and there, but overall, they were clean. Having been in the dustless safe my whole life, I was not thrilled.<br>
            <br>
            My owner kept me in a wallet. Some days passed. I saw my kind getting in and out of my wallet. I had noticed that I was bigger and newer than most of my kindred. One day, he took me out of the wallet and exchanged me with a very intricately shaped glass container. The hands I went to were a bit dirtier than his. Now, my new owner kept me in a counter and when the day finished, took all of us and handed it over to someone else, not taking anything in return. Now, this person had clean hands and although I stayed with him briefly, I loved the feeling of being in them. But my blissful life was short-lived. He exchanged me with someone who had hands so dirty, I would’ve vomited if I could’ve. This audacious guy put me in his chest pocket which was soaked with smell and had small, crumpled and old kindred of mine. I was disgusted. I saw him lowering his head to my previous owner and sweat dripping from his forehead. I hated it there.<br>
            <br>
            Every hand I have been to has treated me with a high degree of respect. But there is one incident I will never forget. I was in the hands of someone who had very clean hands. Back then, I still liked them. Clean pairs of hands I mean. Anyway, we were on a bridge. He accidentally dropped me when he opened his wallet. Since we were in the side, I started falling down, round and round, flipping in the air. I got scared. I knew for a fact that, I would get soaked and in the tremendous flow, get torn to pieces in not time. I looked at my owner thinking he would try something but… he just looked at me and turned away, not caring a bit. As I slowly reached my doom, regret filled my heart. I fell into the water and started drowning along with the flow. With no hope left, I stopped thinking. But then, suddenly a hand grabbed me. It brought me out of the water and saved me. I was saved! In that moment, I didn’t even realize that those hands were by far the dirtiest of them all. He brought me out and dried me in the sun, handling me with utmost care.<br>
            <br>
            I now know, he was a beggar. That was my first and last time in a beggar’s hand. I have gotten old. Slowly, I am starting to crumple. I understand now, the more of me people have, the less they understand my value. I am a thousand taka note. And I, personally, love the dirtiest of hands. <br>

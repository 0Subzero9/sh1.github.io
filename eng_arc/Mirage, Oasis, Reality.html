            Ding! I loosened my arms from the armrest. It had been the plane letting us know we could open our seatbelts. I was freezing. Everybody was getting up and taking their luggage and handbags to the exit. Besides the door, stood a flight attendant who was wishing us a good stay and thanking us for flying with them till the end of the flight. We got down from the plane and looked around and oh my goodness was I speechless. It was about eleven PM in the night and the whole airport was lit up like a firework in the sky. I took a deep breath; the air was a bit cold but humid. A speaker was announcing, “Welcome to Abu Dhabi.” <br>
            <br>
Yes, indeed we had reached one of the most famous and beautiful places in the whole world, The United Arab Emirates. Our destination was the heart of that country, Dubai. A relative of mine was waiting for us with his car. He drove us to his house. The roads were long and wide, and the streetlights were like glowing diamonds under the night sky. I’ve got to say, that drive home was one of the best ones I have ever had and will experience in my life. To my surprise, the traffic was incredibly well-sustained. It was Ramadan, so we had already had our iftar (meal for breaking the fast of Muslims) in the plane. But we were exhausted, so we arrived home and took rest. After a few hours, we took our suhoor (meal for starting one’s fast taken at dawn). The food was incredibly delicious and amazing as it was made by the hands of a fellow Bengali brother, who had slightly mixed both the country’s cuisines.<br>
<br>
We hit the road early in the morning since we had many places to go. We rode a metro which was entirely controlled by artificial intelligence and was going towards our destination, ‘The Dubai Central Mall’. As the train was going through tunnels, it felt as if I was flying through different realms. The sceneries kept changing after going through every tunnel. Finally, we had reached the mall. It was the shape of a globe. It was so big that it seemed as if it were a completely different city. We shopped for a while and also tried a bit of ice skating. Believe me! Ice skating actually felt as if I was flying. Afterwards, we visited the one structure everyone has either heard of, read of or seen at least once in their lives. It was none other than the tallest structure made in history, the legendary ‘Burj Khalifa’. And it was actually taller than I had anticipated. The tip of the building was high to the point of being frightening. And as soon as we ascended to the top floor, the view left me speechless. I felt like I was on cloud nine. After spending a few minutes, we got back down from the building. We had many more places to go and my mind was eager to experience all of them. But not everyone was young like me and had different sentiments. We went back home and took rest.<br>
<br>
The next day, we went to the desert for a safari. We went through the desert to a camp. The desert of Dubai was unlike any other desert I have been to. It was like swimming through a sea of gold. We took a jeep and drove to the camp. The camp had many stalls which had mouth- watering food. So, we decided to roam around and experience everything in the area. And before we knew it, it was evening. But that was really when the place became a radiant star. The entire place was lit up by torches and music started playing. And slowly people started dancing and so did we. We returned home pretty late that night and that day, even I was tired. So I instantly hit the deck the moment we reached home.<br>
<br>
Directly due schedule, second by second, like always, dawned the sun the next day, beckoning our final day here. We went to the one and only seven-star hotel in the entire world, the ‘Burj-Al-Arab’. We went to a dolphin show there where a few trained dolphins displayed magnificent tricks. The food there was expensive, but worth the price without doubt. The overall enjoyment and excitement had made me forget that it was the last day. But then, the realization that the time to leave this spectacular place had come, hit me. I was leaving this place today. <br>
<br>
We got on the plane that night and I don’t know about the others, but I got on with a heavy heart and soon the plane took off.<br>
<br>
Now this is what you really call an ‘Experience to remember’. A mind blowing one, in fact. This journey will have a permanent place in my heart for eternity.<br>

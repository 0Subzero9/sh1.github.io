            The sun has finally shown its red face. In the midst of this dreamy twilight, fresh dew drops can be seen on the grass. The sight of the emerging sun from the far fields under the reddish sky makes quite a view. My back hurts from riding on horseback for so long. “How far is Murshidabad?”, I ask Edward. “It’s still quite long.”, he replies, saddening me. <br>
            <br>
21st June, 1771, I, Captain Edward and Major Nicolas along with some men were dispatched from Calcutta to give aide to our men in Murshidabad. There was a report that the company is having a hard time there. Supposedly, anarchy is going on. Before things get worse, we are to help them. But right now, I just want a warm place to rest. Who knew, a lad from Shire would end up in Bengal. It is totally different from York or any other place I have visited in Europe. “We will halt by the hut. Let’s see if we can get some supplies”, says the Major. I see a shaggy house up ahead. It seems likely to breakdown with the blow of air. I doubt if any poor soul lives there. Well, at least I am getting to ease for a moment. I am shocked to see the scenery as we halt. A skinny young man comes out of the hut. It is as if he only has skin on his bone. A soldier goes forward and pushes the man aside. He was barely standing somehow. But with the push, he falls. Such a weak man! My men pay no heed to him. I offer him some water but he is too weak to drink. The soldier comes out of the hut and confirms that the house is empty. There is a terrible odour coming from inside the hut from which I start to feel a bit nauseous. I give a look inside and instantly feel a cold screech over my chest. There are two rotten bodies of a woman and a child. I get scared seeing the melting blackened bodies and suddenly, a hand grabs me by my shoulder. It is Edward. Pulling me outside the house, he says, “Feel the air, Darling. You are not in Birmingham or Yorkshire anymore.  Welcome to bloody India. Here, bodies rot in less than four days.” I do not like the feeling I’m getting.<br>
<br>
We’ll reach Murshidabad in a few moments as we had started at the first light. The company is not bad, Corporal Arthur has been singing songs the whole way. The Irish accent is good. A great group of men gathering on the bank of a river catches my attention. All of them have circled a pile of woods. It’s a Hindu funeral. I had heard about it but never seen it. “Let’s watch”. I think. With 5 men, I ride in. They don’t seem to like us. Luckily, I have an Indian soldier in my army. Sepoy Harpreet helps me talk. I ask what is special about that man. There are a lot of men there. The appearance of the skinny man does not seem to be very noble. “The man died of hunger even though he was self-sufficient. He had given most of his supplies to the poor. What time has come!” one of the men say. As the body gets burned, I look at the black smoke and wonder,” A solvent man gets poor death trying to feed others. His soul may surely be delivered to paradise, but what do we have? Where will we go?”<br>
<br>
As we reached Murshidabad, I am shocked to see the Nawab’s capital. The markets are empty, beggars dying at the street, people wearing half-torn clothes. I realize the scale of the anarchy going on. I am amazed to see the company stockpile compared to the city. I can see how the outpost would withstand a siege for five years. I start to roam around the city for a stroll and all I find is broken carts and empty shops.<br>
<br>
The sun starts wailing to the west and the mosque is calling for prayer. Seems like a ruined city, a ghetto. I find a large group of men carrying a body to a graveyard. The man was beaten and killed by the company soldiers. The man was a worker to the company yet he had snitched a pack of grain to a poor family. I can tell he hasn’t eaten anything for days. He died a hero for that family. We have so much supplies for ourselves that we can grow fat and old yet these men die of hunger.<br>
<br>
On my way back, I find a cart full of grain passing through. “Is it going to the market?” “No, sire. All the grains go to the company first.” Passing by, a gold smith is weeping as two Englishmen get out of his shop with a bag of gold coins in the name of tax.<br>
<br>
I could protest but I won’t. People here die of hunger yet we hoard more than enough. I can’t say anything. Its my duty. I don’t have the upbringing nor the courage to do anything. The Hindu noble man, the company worker, they will be remembered as heroes. They surely have something to tell God. What will I say after I die wearing the clothes stolen from a poor Indian? As the sun goes home for the day over the horizon, I look at the torn sails drifting slowly on the shining Vagirothi river and wonder,” Will God ever forgive us for what we have done to ourselves?”<br>

    <div class="story">
        <p>I want to go back <br>
            In the midst of peace and joy<br>
            Where the stream is flowing by,<br>
            Where you can never annoy. <br>
            <br>
            In the beds of the river<br>
            And to walk by the loamy stay<br>
            Motorcycle horns, engineâ€™s<br>
            Oh, gentle breeze! Take all these away.<br>
            <br>
            I want to go back<br>
            Where the rivulet is beckoning,<br>
            To ablution in the river bed<br>
            When the stream goes murmuring.<br>
            <br>
             I want to go back<br>
            To the green meadow<br>
            Where the cattle are grazing<br>
            Under the willow.<br>
            <br>
            I want to go back<br>
            To my own world eternally<br>
            Where the sky and earth merge together,<br>
            Oh! I want to go back forever.<br>
            </p>

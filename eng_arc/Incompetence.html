    <h1>Incompetence</h1>
    <h2>-Sheikh (3216)</h2>

    <div class="story">
        <p>
            With the withering rose held in my hand, <br>
Smiling, by the window I stand.<br>
Funny how life feels so light,<br>
For now, it is a mess, nothing is right.<br>
<br>
Just like the rose I wanted to be,<br>
For the epitome of perfection,<br>
Was what it had come to be.<br>
Amidst this I forgot to care<br>
For the feelings of my head.<br>
I fell into this large mess,<br>
As my mind blended with sense.<br>
<br>
But then I understood,<br>
Eternal nor internal beauty is real,<br>
As such people aren’t perfect.<br>
Souls get smashed,<br>
Words fall in the dark,<br>
When someone dislikes me for themselves<br>
What’s the point of being myself?<br>
Society is something I can’t deal with,<br>
They will find fault with me for everything.<br>
